# Latitude Data Analysis Visualization Dashboard

For this project I created a visualization dashboard using the weather data of 574 random cities that was collected as part of the Python-Api-Challenge. The csv file (titled cities.csv) containing the weather data can be found in the Resources folder. This data was used in the previous project to analyze the relationships (or lack of relationships) between latitude and weather patterns such as max temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed. Plots were created of these relationships using Matplotlib and can be found in the Assets folder. Using the weather data and plots, I created a dashboard to show these comparisons, plots, data analysis, and relationships between latitude and these weather phenomena. 

The website contains seven pages. These pages include:

  - A landing page providing an explanation of the project, links to in-depth analyses of each plot, a link to the data table, and a link to a comparisons page. In addition, the landing page contains a sidebar with images of each relationship plot. 
  - Four visualization pages containing each of the plots comparing latitude to max temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed. 
  - A comparisons page that contains all four plots for easier comparisons. 
  - A data page that shows a table containing the data used for this project. 
  

All code, data, and images can be found in the WebVisualizations folder. Once in the WebVisualizations folder, the landing page html code, data html code, and comparisons html code can be found in the HTML folder. Images of the plots, saved as .png, are available in the Assets folder. The Visualizations folder contains the html code for each of the visualziation pages, and the Resouces folder contains the csv file and the Python code that was used to convert the csv file into the cities.html file.
